Okay so that seems to all work fine, how about some other stuff like *italic* text and using an alternative _italic_ text syntax to make it look more classic and give it a bit of an italian look.
  
And some **bold** text to make it stronger and stuff.

Or **_bold and italic_** just like that
  
And what about bold with a __alternative syntax__.
  
Oh and hey when we're at it why not add some ~~striked through~~ text as well right?
  
## Just other stuff

But what about some lists?
  
* Bananas
* Apples
* Grapefruits
* Oranges
  
And with some numberssss
  
1. Star Trek
2. Good Fellas
3. Star Wars
4. Legally Blond
  
How about *some* **yeah** or **oh YEAH!**
  
#### Finding new YEAH's!
  
```language-js
ws.getMonkeys(race, type, callback);
```
  
And what about some more **bold** and *italic* text then, maybe also some ~~striked through text~~?
  
### What about some code?
  
Gotta love some inline `{}` objects and other code like `window.getMonkeys`.

#### Single lined
